# Meteor Tutorial on Medium

### A tutorial for the dumb like me

I wanted to learn Meteor inside and out and the best way to learn it is to explain it to the most uneducated coders. This is my attempt. I do not claim that any of my code is best or right or even correct. If you find an issue in it, PLEASE let me know and if you can help me learn why it was wrong. I want to help as much as I need to learn. [MeteorJS](http://www.meteor.com) is the first framework that just //made// //sense// out of the box and hopefully I can explain it for those that learn like me.
